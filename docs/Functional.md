## Objectives

It will be a single web page with an input field. The user will be able to enter a postal address or a coordinate and the page will show the time for Santa to arrive on the page.

The service will be able to scale depending on the number of requests per minute.

It will be supported by the majority of current browsers OSs and devices.

If the user accepts the use of his location, the service will use his coordinates to calculate the time for Santa to arrive. However, it will not disable the search bar in case he wants to see the time for another place.

## User documentation

Write your adress in the field. And press enter.
